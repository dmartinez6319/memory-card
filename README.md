# Memory Card

Odin Project Series

This project is a memory card game where players aim to click on unique cards without repeating any selections. Each correct selection increases the score, while selecting a previously clicked card resets the game. The game features randomized card positions and visual feedback for correct choices.

The application is built using React, following a component-based architecture. It utilizes React hooks like useState and useEffect for managing game state, card shuffling, and rendering side effects. The game logic is modular, with separate components for the play area, cards, and score management, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

Styling is managed through component-specific CSS files, promoting modularity and preventing global style conflicts. Animations, such as checkmark feedback for correct selections, are implemented using CSS keyframes for a smooth user experience.

The website is deployed using Vercel.
